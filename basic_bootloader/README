This is a basic "hello world" bootloader, which just prints the string.
Its functionality is limited to printing a string and will not be able to load a kernel into memory.

How to use?
        make run 

        - This will compile the bootloader and run on qemu

What happens here?
1. BIOS loads first 512 bytes from disk into memory at 0x7C00
2. CPU starts to execute from 0x7C00 in 16-bit real mode
3. int 0x10 (BIOS interrupt 0x10) displays text on screen 
4. Boot sector ends with required signature 0xAA55
